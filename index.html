        <h4>Rock! Papers! Scissors! Shoot!</h4>
        <p><strong>I wrote ths pseudocode in the .js file</strong></p>
        <p>// This is going to be the main area that we write the rock, paper, scissors function

            <p>/* pseudocode area - </p>
            
            <p>start best of 5 rps game
            
            create player and create computer character
            
            if player or pc has not won 3 games, keep playing</p>
            
            <p>>keep playing - </p>
            
            <p>  selection either rock, paper, or scissors
            
                computer randomly selects random rock, paper, or scissors
            
                player makes selection - either rock, paper or scissors
            
                else print, sorry you must select either Rock, Paper, or scissors </p>
            
            
            
            <p>selection results</p>
            
            <p>   if selection is Rock, it is greater than  scissors, and less than paper
            
                else if selection is Paper, it is greater than rock, and less than scissors
            
                else if selection is Scissors, it is greater than paper, and less than rock</p>
            
                
            
            
            <p>compare selections</p>
            
            <p>    If player selection is greater than computer selection, then player wins round
            
                else the computer wins round</p>
            
            <p>End game

                else if computer wins 3 round, then computer wins - GAME OVER
            
                else GAME continues until one player wins three round */</p>
